We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status. The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates in good faith and in accordance with this Covenant.

- **Acknowledge different experiences** and skill levels
- **Accept responsibility** for mistakes and learn from them

- **Remove, edit, or reject** contributions that don't align with this Code of Conduct
- **Temporarily or permanently ban** contributors for behaviors deemed harmful

## Encouraged Behaviors

While acknowledging differences in social norms, we all strive to meet our community's expectations for positive behavior. We also understand that our words and actions may be interpreted differently than we intend based on culture, background, or native language.

With these considerations in mind, we agree to behave mindfully toward each other and act in ways that center our shared values, including:

1. Respecting the **purpose of our community**, our activities, and our ways of gathering.
2. Engaging **kindly and honestly** with others.
3. Respecting **different viewpoints** and experiences.
4. **Taking responsibility** for our actions and contributions.
5. Gracefully giving and accepting **constructive feedback**.
6. Committing to **repairing harm** when it occurs.
7. Behaving in other ways that promote and sustain the **well-being of our community**.

### Unacceptable Behavior ‚ùå

We agree to restrict the following behaviors in our community. Instances, threats, and promotion of the behaviors listed below are violations of this Code of Conduct.

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- **Harassment or discrimination** of any kind
- **Trolling, insulting, or derogatory** comments
- **Personal or political attacks** on individuals
- **Character attacks.** Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments directed at a community member or group of people

## Reporting Instructions

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [INSERT CONTACT METHOD].

All reports will be reviewed promptly and fairly. Community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of anyone who reports an incident.

We encourage you to report violations as soon as possible. In your report, please include:
- Your contact information
- Names of any individuals involved and witnesses
- Description of the incident
- Dates and locations of the incident
- Any supporting documentation or evidence

## üö® Enforcement

We believe in education over punishment when possible:

- **First-time violations** often receive guidance rather than penalties
- **Mentorship opportunities** for those who want to improve
- **Clear explanations** of why certain behavior is problematic
- **Resources and support** for understanding inclusive practices

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to actions taken outside of these spaces that affect the health and safety of community members.
